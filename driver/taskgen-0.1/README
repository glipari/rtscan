TaskGen v1.0 - by Paul Emberson <paule -at-domain- rapitasystems.com>
======================================================================
This is a Python script for generating task-sets for multi-processor
systems with Roger Stafford's randfixedsum algorithm. It requires the
numpy library (http://numpy.scipy.org/). It has been tested with
Python 2.6.5 and numpy 1.4.1 and also Python 2.7 and the latest svn of
numpy (as showing up on July, 12th).

There isn't a website for the tool at the moment, so it is being
distributed through the WATERS 2010 webpage. However, this initial
release and any subsequent ones will be announced on the Rapita
Systems blog at http://www.rapitasystems.com/blog.

There isn't any documentation for the software either. However, if you
type taskgen.py --help then you will get an insightful help message.
