-- Real-Time-SC-hedulability -AN-alyser ---
-------------------------------------------

This is a set of libraries and a set of programs
for performing scheduling analysis of real-time 
systems. The intention is to provide a repository
that collects real-time scheduling analysis formulas
and programs, so that researchers do not need to 
implement everything from scratch every time. 

The programs and the libraries are written in C++. 
You need:

- the latest GNU g++ compiler (> 4.6)
- the boost spirit library
- the boost filestystem library
- the google test library
- the automake and autoconf tools

They should be all available in your Linux distribution. 
On Ubuntu and Debian, check with apt-cache and apt-get.

Google Test is only needed if you wish to run the tests 
(strongly suggested!). Please download it from here: 

  http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

and follow instructions to compile and install. 

To compile the libraries and the programs: 

> autoreconf
> ./configure
> make

To compile and run the tests

> make check

The programs are in directory drivers/. 

To add your own files: modify the Makefile.am file in 
the appropriate directory, then run again autoreconf, 
./configure and make from the main project directory.

The idea is to put 
- common utility files in directory common/
- models of tasks, processors, distributed platforms, etc.
  in models/
- schedulability analysis functions and classes in analysis/

If you want to add your own analysis or task model, please 
also consider to write appropriate tests for them. Add the 
corresponding test files into the test/ directory. 

As you can see, most of the files are header files and 
most of them heavily use templates for maximum reuse. 

Have fun!
