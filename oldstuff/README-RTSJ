This repository contains all source code used for the simulation
experiments performed in the paper:

"Analysis and Implementation of the Multiprocessor BandWidth
Inheritance Protocol" Dario Faggioli, Giuseppe Lipari, Tommaso
Cucinotta, Real-Time System Journal

To run the experiments, you should first configure and compile the
rtscan library, following the instruction in file README.

The files for the experiments are located in directory:

  rtscan/driver/mbwi_exps

In that directory, you should first compile the source files of the
experiments, simply typing

  $ make

then, you move into directory exps/, and run the experiments with the 
two script files:

  $ ./run.sh
  $ ./run_omlp.sh

Finally, you can generate all graphs by running the following script
files (this requires that you have gnuplot installed on your system):

  $ ./plot_u.sh
  $ ./plot_t.sh
  $ ./plot_u_omlp.sh
  $ ./plot_t_omlp.sh

The experiments were run on a Linux machine with a UBUNTU distribution.
The compiler used to compile everything is 

  gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
